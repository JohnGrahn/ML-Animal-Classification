# ML-Animal-Classification
Machine learning application for the classification of animals

This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based machine learning program for classifying images of cats and dogs. 
The program utilizes popular machine learning libraries and techniques to build and train a classifier that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

# Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook program demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model to classify whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

# Installation / Usage
The main purpose of this application is to classify whether an image is of a dog or a cat. For that purpose is is recommended to upload this jupyter notebook to Google Colab, 
and then follow the instructs in the notebook. The training process is very resource intensive which is why the model has been trained and saved. Using Google Colab also allows the user to avoid worrying about installing development environment dependencies  If using Google Colab, a command can be found in the notebook to download the saved model directly to Colab so you donâ€™t need to upload it.

# Dataset
This application was trained on this dataset from Kaggle.
